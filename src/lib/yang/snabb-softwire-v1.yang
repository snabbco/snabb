        The lightweight 4-over-6 architecture supports sharing of
        IPv4 addresses by partitioning the space of TCP/UDP/ICMP
        ports into disjoint \"port sets\".  Each softwire associated
        with an IPv4 address corresponds to a different set of ports
        on that address.  The way that the ports are partitioned is
        specified in RFC 7597:  each address has an associated set
        of parameters that specifies how to compute a \"port set
        identifier\" (PSID) from a given port.
