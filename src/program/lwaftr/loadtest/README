Usage: loadtest [OPTIONS] <PCAP-FILE> <TX-NAME> <RX-NAME> <PCI> [<PCAP-FILE> <TX-NAME> <RX-NAME> <PCI>]...

  -b BITRATE, --bitrate BITRATE
                             Peak at BITRATE bits/second.
  -s STEP, --step STEP
                             Increase bitrate in increments of STEP bits/second.
  -D DURATION, --duration DURATION
                             Linger on each step for DURATION seconds.
  -p PROGRAM, --program PROGRAM
                             Use workload PROGRAM.
  --bench-file FILENAME
                             The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                             written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                             will be based on the current directory. Default
                             is "bench.csv".
  -y, --hydra
                             Hydra mode: emit CSV data in the format expected
                             by the Hydra reports. For instance:

                               benchmark,id,score,unit

                             rather than the default:

                               load_gbps,stream,tx_packets,tx_mpps,tx_bytes,
                                 tx_gbps,rx_packets,rx_mpps,rx_bytes,rx_gbps,
                                 ingress_drop,lost_packets,lost_percent
  --cpu CPU
                             Bind to the given CPU.
  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.

Transmit packets from the PCAP-FILE packet captures to the corresponding
PCI network adaptors.

The available workload programs are:

  --program ramp_up

    Start at zero bits per second, ramping up to BITRATE bits per
    second in increments of STEP bits per second, lingering at each
    step for DURATION seconds.  The default is to ramp to 10 Gbps in
    increments of 1 Gbps, lingering for 5 seconds at each step.

  --program ramp_down

    The same as ramp_up, but in the opposite direction.

  --program ramp_up_down

    A ramp_up followed by a ramp_down.

The default workload program is ramp_up_down.

Packets received on the network interfaces are counted and recorded,
and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates are written
to standard output in human-readable format, and also to a file in CSV
format, suitable for passing to a graphing program.  The TX-NAME values
are used to label the columns.  The RX-NAME values indicate interfaces
on which we should be looking for a response.  Packets sent but not
received will be counted as loss.

Examples:
  loadtest cap1.pcap tx tx 01:00.0
  loadtest -D 1 -b 5e9 -s 0.2e9 cap1.pcap "NIC 0" "NIC 1" 01:00.0 cap2.pcap "NIC 1" "NIC 0" 01:00.1
