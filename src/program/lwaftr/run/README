Usage: run --help
       run --conf <conf-file> --v4 <pci-addr> --v4 <pci-addr> [OPTION...]
       run --conf <conf-file> --on-a-stick <pci-addr> [OPTION...]

Required arguments:
       --conf   <conf-file>     Sets configuration policy table
       --v4 <pci-addr>          PCI device number for the INET-side NIC
       --v6 <pci-addr>          PCI device number for the B4-side NIC
       --on-a-stick <pci-addr>  One single NIC for INET-side and B4-side

Optional arguments:
       --reconfigurable         Allow run-time configuration query and update.
                                This runs as two processes, a leader and a
                                follower, rather than just one.
       --virtio                 Use virtio-net interfaces instead of Intel 82599
       --ring-buffer-size <size>  Set Intel 82599 receive buffer size
       --cpu    <cpu>           Bind the lwAFTR to the given CPU
       --real-time              Enable real-time SCHED_FIFO scheduler
       --mirror <tap>           Copies matching packets to TAP interface. Matching
                                address set by "lwaftr monitor".
       -D       <seconds>       Duration in seconds
       -v                       Verbose (repeat for more verbosity)
       -y, --hydra
                                Hydra mode: emit CSV data in the format expected
                                by the Hydra reports. For instance:

                                  benchmark,id,score,unit

                                rather than the default:

                                  Time (s),Decap. MPPS,Decap. Gbps,Encap. MPPS,Encap. Gbps
       -b FILENAME, --bench-file FILENAME
                                The file or path name where benchmark data is to
                                be written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                                will be based on the current directory.
       -n NAME, --name NAME     Sets the name as the identifier of this program.
                                This must be unique amongst other snab programs.

When the -v option is used at least once, packets on the network interfaces are
counted and recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates
are written to stdout in CSV format, suitable for passing to a graphing program.
If bench-file is set, output is written to a file instead of stdout.
