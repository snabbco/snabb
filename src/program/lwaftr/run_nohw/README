       --bench-file, -b FILENAME
                            The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                            written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                            will be based on the current directory. Default
                            is "bench.csv".

When the -v option is used at least once, packets on the network interfaces are
counted and recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates
are written to a file in CSV format, suitable for passing to a graphing program.
