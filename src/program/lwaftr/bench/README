  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.
  -y, --hydra
                             Hydra mode: emit CSV data in the format expected
                             by the Hydra reports. For instance:

                               benchmark,id,score,unit

                             rather than the default:

                               Time (s),Decap. MPPS,Decap. Gbps,Encap. MPPS,Encap. Gbps
  -b FILENAME, --bench-file FILENAME
                              The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                              written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                              will be based on the current directory. Default
                              is "bench.csv".
  -D DURATION, --duration DURATION
                             Duration in seconds.

Run the lwAFTR with input from IPV4-IN.PCAP and IPV6-IN.PCAP. The bench
command is used to get an idea of the raw speed of the lwaftr without
interaction with NICs, or check the impact of changes on a development
machine that may not have Intel 82599 NICs.  Exit when finished.  This
program is used in the lwAFTR test suite.

Packets are counted and recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing
packet rates are written to a file in CSV format, suitable for passing to a
graphing program.
