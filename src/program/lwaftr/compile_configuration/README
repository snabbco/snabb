Validate and compile a configuration file.

A lwAFTR configuration file follows the schema described in
`lib/yang/snabb-softwire-v3.yang`.  It consists of several containers
such as `binding-table`, `external-interface` and `internal-interface` and
`instance`.

A binding table is a collection of softwires (tunnels).  One endpoint
of the softwire is in the AFTR and the other is in the B4.  A
softwire provisions an IPv4 address (or a part of an IPv4 address) to
a customer behind a B4.  The B4 arranges for all IPv4 traffic to be
encapsulated in IPv6 and sent to the AFTR; the AFTR does the reverse.
The binding table is how the AFTR knows which B4 is associated with
an incoming packet.

This command will atomically overwrite the output file.  If the output
file name LWAFTR.O is not given as an argument, the output file
will be the name of the input file, minus a ".conf" suffix if present,
plus a ".o" suffix.

Note that when a lwAFTR is started, it will automatically compile its
configuration file if needed.  However for large tables (millions of entries)
this can take a second or two, so it can still be useful to compile a
configuration file ahead of time.  If you do this, you can send a SIGHUP to
the AFTR to cause it to reload the file.
