snabbnfv neutron2snabb <csv-dir> <output-dir> [<hostname>]

(This program is used internally by the neutron-sync-master command.)

Generate configuration files for Snabb Switch traffic processes based
on an OpenStack Neutron database dump in CSV format (from mysqldump).

<csv-dir> must contain ports.txt, networks.txt, and ml2_nework_segments.txt.

<output-dir> will be populated with one file for each physical_network
describing how Neutron ports should be connected to provider networks.

<hostname> can optionally be specified mainly for testing purposes,
default is the string returned by hostname(1).
