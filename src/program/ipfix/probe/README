Usage: snabb ipfix probe [options] <input> <output> [<template> ...]
       snabb ipfix probe --help

Available options:
       -m, --host-mac <macaddr> The MAC address of the host running the exporter.
                                Defaults to a randomly generated MAC.
       -a, --host-ip  <ipaddr>  The IP address of the host running the exporter.
                                Defaults to 10.0.0.1.
       -c, --collector <ipaddr> The IP address of the flow collector.
                                Defaults to 10.0.0.2.
       -i, --input-type <type>  One of pcap, raw, tap, or pci. Specifies
                                how to interpret the <input> argument. Interprets
                                <input> as a pcap file path, device name, or
                                PCI address optionally followed by the number of
                                the receive queue for RSS, separated by '/',
                                respectively. Defaults to pci.
       -o, --output-type <type> Takes the same values as -i with the addition of
                                tap_routed, but for <output>.  For tap_routed, <output>
                                is the name of the device optionally followed by the
                                MTU (including the Ethernet header), separated by ':'.
       -D, --duration <seconds> Duration to run (in seconds).
       -p, --port <port>        The port on the collector to send to. Defaults
                                to port 4739.
       --mtu <mtu>              The MTU in bytes including the 14-byte Ethernet header
                                used when determining the size of export packets. If the
                                output type is tap_routed, the MTU is applied to the
                                tap interface as well.  Defaults to 1514.
       --active-timeout <secs>  The timeout period for flows that are still receiving
                                packets (in seconds).
       --idle-timeout <secs>    The timeout period for flows with no recent activity
                                (in seconds).
       --flush-timeout <secs>   The timeout period after which an export packet is
                                sent even if it is not of maximum possible size (limited
                                by the MTU). Defaults to 10 seconds.
       --scan-time <secs>       The number of seconds it takes for a scan of the flow
                                cache to find flows eligible for export of each configured
                                template. Defaults to 10.
       --cache-size <number>    The initial size of the flow caches of all configured
                                templates in number of flows.  Defaults to 20000.
       --observation-domain <domain>
                                The observation domain to be used for exported IPFIX
                                flows. Defaults to 256.
       --template-refresh <seconds>
                                The interval at which template records are sent in
                                seconds. Defaults to 600.
       --netflow-v9             Use the Netflow V9 protocol to communicate to the
                                flow collector.
       --ipfix                  Use IPFIX to communicate with the flow collector.
                                (mutually exclusive with --netflow-v9, --ipfix is
                                 the default)
       --transport <proto>      The transport protocol to use to communicate to
                                the flow collector. Valid values depend on whether
                                IPFIX or Netflow V9 is used.
       --cpu <cpu>              Bind to the given CPU.  See the Snabb
                                performance guide for more details.
       -b, --busy-wait          Enable polling for arriving packets.  By default, the system
                                uses sleep(3) during periods of little or no traffic to
                                reduce CPU usage.
       -j CMD, --jit CMD        Control LuaJIT behavior. Available commands:
                                  -jv=FILE, --jit v=FILE
                                    Write verbose JIT trace output to FILE.
                                  -jdump=OPTS[,FILE] --jit dump=OPTS[,FILE]
                                    Output JIT traces, optionally to a file.
                                  -jp=OPTS[,FILE] --jit p=OPTS[,FILE]
                                    Profile execution with low-overhead sampling.
                                  -jopt=OPT
                                    Sets JIT option OPT.
                                  -jtprof
                                    Profile execution with the traceprof library.

The mandatory arguments <input> and <output> are followed by an
ordered list of template specifications in the form
<name>[:<cache-size>], where <name> must be the name of a valid
template defined in apps.ipfix.template.lua and <cache-size> is the
optional value of the initial size of the flow cache for the template
in units of the number of flows.  The templates are processed in the
given order when incoming packets are processed.  The packet is passed
to the first matching template only.

The default is "v4 v6".
